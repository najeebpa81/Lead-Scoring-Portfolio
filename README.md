# High-Velocity Lead Scoring & Precision Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases advanced data-driven solutions for sales optimization in the **UAE (GCC) and SEA (Singapore/Global)** markets. 

Unlike standard data science approaches, these projects are built with a **"Zero-Defect" mindset**—leveraging my professional background in **Analytical Chemistry** and **Semiconductor/Disk Drive Manufacturing** to ensure data integrity and statistical rigor.

## 🛠️ The Technical Moat: "The Physics of Data"

I bridge the gap between complex ML models and executive trust by applying industrial quality standards to AI:

* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Utilizing **SHAP (Beeswarm & Waterfall plots)** to provide a "Certificate of Analysis" for every prediction.
* **Statistical Integrity:** Applying **ADF Testing** for stationarity and custom feature engineering (Lags/Rolling Stats) derived from high-precision sensor logic.
* **Lean Data Governance:** Implementing **ISO 9001/Lean Manufacturing** principles to Data Lifecycle Management to minimize "data contamination."

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. 🏙️ Dubai Real Estate: Investor Tiering & Market Intelligence
**Focus:** Regional Market Intelligence (UAE)
* **Context:** Prioritizing high-value investors in the volatile Dubai property market.
* **The Analytical Lens:** Treated "Market Noise" with the same scrutiny used in ICP-MS trace metal analysis, isolating luxury price tiers and "Hot Areas" (Palm Jumeirah/Downtown).
* **Key Outcome:** Automated prioritization of the top 7% "Platinum" leads, allowing senior brokers to focus on high-probability conversions.
* **📂 [View Project & Documentation](./02_Dubai_Real_Estate_Rule_Based)**

### 2. 🧠 Bank Marketing: Predictive ML (Explainable AI)
**Focus:** Stakeholder Trust & Precision Accuracy
* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier + SHAP (Explainable AI).
* **Performance:** **95% ROC-AUC** (Top 1% global benchmark).
* **The XAI Edge:** Every lead score is 100% transparent. Using SHAP, I visualize the *why* behind every score, moving AI from a "Black Box" to a strategic tool for sales managers.

### 3. 🏦 Bank Marketing: Rule-Based Scoring Engine
**Focus:** Immediate ROI & Business Logic Alignment
* **Logic:** A heuristic weighting engine based on call duration, previous success, and liability filtering.
* **Industrial Alignment:** Designed like an SPC (Statistical Process Control) system to trigger alerts on high-probability "Hot" tiers.

## 💼 Specialized Service Pillars (UAE / Singapore / SEA)

I provide high-level consultancy for firms requiring precision-engineered data solutions:

1.  **Lead Scoring & XAI Strategy:** Building models where the logic is as clear as a chemical lab report.
2.  **Industrial Demand Forecasting:** Applying time-series intelligence to commercial inventory to reduce operational waste.
3.  **Predictive Maintenance (In Progress):** Leveraging NASA gas turbine datasets to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for precision manufacturing assets.
