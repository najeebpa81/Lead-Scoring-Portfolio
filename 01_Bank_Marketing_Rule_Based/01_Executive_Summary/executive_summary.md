## Key Strategic Insights

Based on the rule-based analysis of your 41,188 clients, we have identified three critical conversion drivers:

1. **Previous Success**: Clients with `poutcome = success` show an **85–95%** conversion probability.
2. **The Engagement Metric**: Call duration is the #1 predictor; interactions exceeding 10 minutes are prioritized as "Hot."
3. **Liability Filtering**: Active housing loan holders convert **60% less often**, allowing you to de-prioritize this segment to save operational costs.
