## 🏗️ Methodology: Rule-Based Heuristics
Unlike "Black Box" AI models, this system uses a **transparent weighting engine** designed for high-speed auditability. The system scores 41,188 clients based on historical success indicators:

* **Success Weighting:** Clients with a "Success" outcome in previous campaigns receive the highest priority.
* **Engagement Logic:** Heavy weighting applied to **call duration**, recognizing that longer engagement is the #1 predictor of a fixed-term deposit.
* **Liability Filtering:** Active housing loan holders are de-prioritized as data shows they convert **60% less often**.



---

## 📈 Business Impact & ROI
* **Immediate Prioritization:** Isolated the **Top 200 leads** for immediate high-touch outreach.
* **Operational Savings:** By identifying segments that convert 60% less often (housing loan holders), the bank reduces wasted call time and operational costs.
* **Transparent Logic:** Sales managers can see exactly why a lead is "Hot," allowing for better script preparation and agent alignment.
