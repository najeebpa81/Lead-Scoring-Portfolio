# Quick Start Guide: Implementing Lead Scoring

**Project:** Bank Term Deposit Optimization | **Database Size:** 41,188 Clients

## 1. Accessing the Priority Lists

- **Immediate Action**: Open `02_Top200_Hot_Warm_Leads.xlsx` from the `04_Data_Deliverables` folder.
- **The Master List**: Use `01_Bank_41k_Scored_RuleBased.csv` for larger team distributions or CRM bulk uploads.

## 2. Sales Team Workflow

To achieve maximum conversion, follow this priority sequence:

1. **High-Intensity Outreach (Hot Tier)**: Start with leads scored 100+. These clients have the highest historical probability of subscribing (85%+).
2. **Nurture Campaign (Warm Tier)**: Focus on leads scored 50–99. These require more time to explain the product benefits.
3. **Automation (Cold Tier)**: Do not assign these to phone agents. Route them to automated SMS or Email marketing to preserve your team's energy.

## 3. Strategic Talking Points (Based on the Logic)

Equip your agents with these insights before they call:

- **Previous Success**: "We are following up on our successful previous interaction..."
- **Engagement Strategy**: The model shows that Duration is the #1 driver. Encourage agents to ask open-ended questions to keep the client on the phone longer than 5 minutes.
- **Liquidity Check**: Target clients without housing loans, as they typically have more disposable income for term deposits.

## 4. Expected Performance (ROI)

By using this ranked approach instead of random dialing, you should observe:

- **3x Increase** in successful subscriptions per hour of talk time.
- **60% Reduction** in wasted calls to low-propensity segments (like those with heavy housing debt).
- **Higher Agent Morale** due to significantly higher "Yes" rates on the Hot tier.
