# How to Use Your Dubai Real Estate Lead Scoring Package

This quick start guide helps your sales team quickly implement the rule-based lead scoring model for 41,381 properties. By prioritizing scored leads, you can focus outreach on high-potential luxury listings and improve conversion rates.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

Follow these simple steps to get started and maximize results:

1. **Access Your Priority Leads**: Open the file `02_Top200_Hot_Warm_Leads.xlsx`. This spreadsheet contains your 200 highest-priority Hot and Warm leads, ready for immediate action.
2. **Prioritize Outreach**: Sort the leads in the spreadsheet by `lead_score` in descending order. Start calling from the top of the list to target the properties with the greatest buyer appeal.
3. **Explore Interactively**: Open the included Tableau dashboard. Use filters for area, price range, lead tier, or other criteria to drill down into specific segments of the full database.
4. **Understand Any Score**: Need to know why a specific lead received a score like 94 points? Reach out to me—I can provide a live waterfall breakdown explaining every point contribution in just 5 seconds.

## Expected Results

By following this prioritized approach instead of random outreach, you can expect:
- **35–55% conversion rate** on the Hot tier leads (compared to the usual 8–12% for unfiltered calling).
- Faster deal closures in high-demand areas like Dubai Marina, Palm Jumeirah, and Downtown.
- Improved agent efficiency and morale from focusing on qualified, high-intent opportunities.
