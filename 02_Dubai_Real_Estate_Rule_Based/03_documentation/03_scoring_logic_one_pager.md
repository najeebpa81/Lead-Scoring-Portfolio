*Rule-Based + Arabic-Ready Scoring Engine*

## Overview

This transparent, rule-based lead scoring model evaluates 41,381 Dubai properties to help your sales team focus on the highest-potential luxury listings first. The engine assigns each property a score from 0 to 200 points based on key drivers of buyer interest and market demand.

## Scoring Rules (Maximum 200 Points)

The final `lead_score` is calculated by adding points from the following criteria:

- **Price ≥ 10M AED** → **+50 points**  
  (Ultra-luxury segment with strongest international buyer demand)
- **Price 5–10M AED** → **+35 points**  
  (Premium luxury tier)
- **Price 2–5M AED** → **+20 points**  
  (High-end segment)
- **Location in Hot Areas** (e.g., Dubai Marina, Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai, JBR, etc.) → **+30 points**  
  (Proven high-demand neighborhoods)
- **4+ Bedrooms** → **+20 points**  
  (Appeals to family buyers and large investors)
- **4+ Bathrooms** → **+15 points**  
  (Indicator of spacious, high-end layout)
- **Ready to Move-In** → **+25 points**  
  (Immediate occupancy drives faster decisions)
- **Arabic Script in Name/Address** → **+15 points**  
  (Cultural relevance for regional buyers)

## Lead Tier Classification

Properties are automatically segmented into actionable tiers based on their final score:

- **Hot (≥ 90 points)**: Highest-priority listings.  
  **Action:** Call TODAY – these have the strongest buyer appeal.
- **Warm (50–89 points)**: Solid potential leads.  
  **Action:** Call within 3 days.
- **Cold (< 50 points)**: Lower immediate potential.
